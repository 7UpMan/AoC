The Advent of Code.

The Advent of Code is an annual event that runs for 25 days in December and finishes on the 25th.  It is best described here: <a href="https://adventofcode.com/">https://adventofcode.com/</a>.

Occasionally, I will complete one of the challenges and be happy enough with the code to make it public.  This is a place for that.
